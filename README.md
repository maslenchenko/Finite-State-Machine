Finite-State-Machine

Finite-State machine implementation written in Python3.

Machine modeles a day from a life.

The work consists of three modules: prime.py, main.py and driver.py.

1. Prime.py contains decorator function which is used in FSM class in main.py module.

2. Driver starts the program.

3. Main.py contains the FSM class.
4.
